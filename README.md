#### What service do you provide?
- Due to COVID-19, interactions between seniors and juniors in the department have been reduced a lot. Therefore, through ICETIME, we developed a web service that allows you to freely talk about your questions while going through school life, such as school life, career and employment, and dating.
- There are two key features currently provided by the service. First, it is not a heavy topic such as employment or career that can be found on the department homepage, but it has created a dating counseling bulletin board that can attract students' attention, increasing the participation rate of students. Second, in order to prevent problems related to anonymity that may occur in systems such as "Everytime service" that is currently in operation, strong sanctions are possible on the admin page by using a nickname when writing posts and comments.
